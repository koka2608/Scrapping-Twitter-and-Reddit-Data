# Scrapping-Twitter-and-Reddit-Data

Web Scrapping is quite an important part when we want to gather sentiment data especially from twitter and reddit.
There are a lot of tweets going out which affects especially the stock market. People's sentiment do play a vital part in the same.

I have published both Pyhton and R codes for the same.

R is so powerful the same function which Python program does in 20-30 lines of code R does that in 4 lines of code with a powerful library called "RedditExtractor".

To scrape data in Python from reddit you need to have a Reddit account and create a webapp in there and give it a name and description.
For reference use the screen shot.
